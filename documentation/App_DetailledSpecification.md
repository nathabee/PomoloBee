Great! Since you've set up the **Gradle dependencies, package name, and sync correctly**, we can now proceed with **building the Jetpack Compose Navigation with a Drawer Menu**.

---

# **🏗️ Project Architecture**
Since **Jetpack Compose doesn't use Fragments**, we will replace the **"1 Activity - Multiple Fragments"** structure with:

- **1 Main Activity**
- **1 NavHost (Handles screen navigation)**
- **Multiple Composable Screens**
- **A Drawer Menu (Navigation Drawer)**

# **📌 Summary**
✔ **No XML – Fully Jetpack Compose**  
✔ **Navigation Drawer with Jetpack Compose**  
✔ **1 Activity managing all screens via `NavHost`**  
✔ **Screens are simple Composable functions**  
✔ **Best Jetpack structure for a modern app**

# **🚀 Next Steps**
Would you like me to:
1. **Integrate OpenCV in CameraScreen?** 📷
2. **Improve UI/UX with Material 3?** 🎨
3. **Setup DataStore to save user settings?** 💾

Let me know what you’d like to build next! 🚀🔥
